\arguments{
  \item{data}{is a matrix containing the data intervals.  The matrix has
two columns.  Each row of the matrix gives one data interval.  The time
value infinity may be coded as NA, Inf, or -99.}

  \item{prior}{is a vector specifying the prior distribution.  It
contains three values a, b, totm0.  The values a, b specify the gamma
mixing distribution.  The value totm0 is the total mass alpha(R) of the
Dirichlet measure.}

  \item{nrep}{is the number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler to
record.}

  \item{control}{is a vector of three values (go, g1, gextra) which
control the running of the Gibbs sampler.  \code{g0} is the warm-up or
burn-in period.  The first g0-1 iterations of the "complete" Gibbs
sampler are discarded.  \code{g1} s the spacing.  Every g1 iterations of
the "complete" Gibbs sampler, we record various statistics (keep running
totals).  \code{gextra} controls the spacing of the "extra step" which
randomizes the position of the atoms.  The extra step is inserted every
gextra sweeps of the "basic" Gibbs sampler.  The gextra sweeps of the
"basic" Gibbs sampler plus the extra step make up one iteration of the
"complete" Gibbs sampler.}

  \item{seed}{is a vector of three integer seeds for the random number
generators.  The first seed should be between 1 and 32.}

  \item{eps}{is a small positive value.  The program currently does not
handle exact observed death times t, but replaces these by interval
censored observations (t-eps,t).}

  \item{adtim}{is a vector of additional time points at which the
survival function is to be computed.  If this is not specified, then the
survival function is only computed at the endpoints of the data
intervals.}
